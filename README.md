cd to the project's directory:
```shell script
sudo apt-get install docker.io docker-compose

You can test everything works fine by accessing the db
from an explorer like dbeaver or the mysql client, and typing something like:
```shell script
mysql -h 192.168.1.8 -P 3308 -u user -p db
````
If you run docker from a linux VirtualBox machine,
make sure to use a **BridgedAdapter** from your network settings.

## DB Setup
If you want to change the database configuration, you will need to modify the 
docker-compose.yml file and the hibernate.cfg.xml file
